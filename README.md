# Bunny

**TUI-based Code Editor** built using Python's Textual framework.

Bunny is a terminal-based user interface (TUI) for editing code, viewing directories, and running terminal commands. It combines a code editor, directory viewer, and terminal within a single, easy-to-use interface. Itâ€™s designed for users who prefer a text-based interface over traditional graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
